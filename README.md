Compass Vertical Rhythms (Without Compass)
================================
This is a git repo for using Compass Vertical Rhythms (with Rem) without the Compass dependency. It's an unofficial port that will only be updated from time to time.

**Edit: I don't recommend using Compass vertical rhythms anymore. Use another library [typi](https://github.com/zellwk/typi) which I created instead**/
